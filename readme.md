## Concept

_Ladybug Web provides [analemma]( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analemma ), solar and weather data visualization and analysis on the web and in your browser_


### Mission

<!-- * Fabricate free, fast, fun fantasies -->
* Write cookbook scripts that are ready to use, cut and paste
* Build engineering tools built to solve specific problems
* Develop skills you can use everywhere

### Vision

* If the mundane engineering tasks become easy, inexpensive and swift to carry out,
then possibilities arise for the more complex, sophisticated and even extravagant ideas to turn into realities
* RIP Zaha Hadid. Let us continue to design with your disruptive yet aways elegant spirit

## Content

There are four different types of scripts here

### Analemmas

The traditional figure eight ( or infinity symbol on its side) representation of Sun positions. In 3D with geolocation and maps.


### Shadows

View the shadows on a 3D model of your choice - given latitude, longitude, data and time. Displays OBJ and MTL files using drag and drop.
Also displays analemmas and is adjustable using a variety of parameters.

Three types of file

* Core - the basic 'engine' you can share and and embed
* Opener - the 'editor' that helps adjust the parameters used by core
* Gallery - display your projects in a variety of way


### Shadow Range

View the shadows cast by your 3D model at hourly intervals - up to 15 - for any month, day latitude and longitude.

Types of files are the same as the Shadow range


### Solar Calculator

The process of calculating the position of the sun is moderately complex. We have four:

* Ladybug Web
* NOAA
* Bostock
* Agafonkin

There is also a script that compares the output for all four scripts


## Features

Generally the following scripts are:

* Free and open source. See the [License]( https://ladybug-tools.github.io/ladybug-web/index.htm#license.md )
* Built using entry level JavaScript with no dependencies other than the [Three.js]( https://threejs.org ) JavaScript library
* Follow the guidelines of the [Ladybug Web Coding Style]( https://ladybug-tools.github.io/ladybug-web/index.html#coding-style.md )
* Linked together using this page. For more information on how this page obtains and displays its content see: [Project Explorer Read Me]( https://ladybug-tools.github.io/ladybug-web/index.html#project-explorer-readme.md )

The 3D views below enable you to rotate and pan using one three fingers or left button, scroll wheel and right button on a mouse.
In these views only, zooming is disabled because it interferes with scrolling the page
